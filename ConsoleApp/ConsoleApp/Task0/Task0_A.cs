         * You need to memorize and know by heart what is a method and struction of the method.
         *  Method aka Function. they can be used interchangably I think C# calls them methods while some
         *  other programming language may call them functions. But they mean same and we can use them interchangably
         * 
         * The sturcture is 
         *      AccessModifier ReturnType NameOfTheMethod(Parametr(s)) {     return ReturnType;}
         * Ex:
         * 
         *      public string HelloWorldFunction( string StringParameter, int intParameter) 
         *      {   
         *          return "";
         *      }
         * 
         * public               = AccessModifier  http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/wxh6fsc7.aspx
         * string               = return type     http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms228360(v=vs.90).aspx
         * HelloWorldFunction   = method Name     Method, Function same thing...
         * stringParameter      = parameter1 of type string
         * intParameter         = parameter2 of type int
         * return ""            = returns empty string
         * 
         * 
         * There are limited number of AccessModifiers you can read about them from the link above. For now we can 
         *           just focuse on public and do not worry too much about others
         *           
         * There are numberous ReturnTypes. ReturnTypes could be any Type. The link has list of all premetive dataTypes that C# 
         *           comes with (If I do not explain something; for example you might ask what does premitive type means for the
         *                        language feel free to goodle it. Actually that would be one of the excersises)
         *                        
         * The name of the function could be anything. By the C# convention All the names start with the Upper case and every word
         *          in the name is also capitilized ex: JustLikeThis
         *          
         * Just like ReturnType parameters could be any type. You can notice that in example function return type and 1st parameter
         *          have same type.
         *          
         * Whatever function return type is must match what the function returns. For example if return type is int you need to 
         *          return int. if it is string then function should return string.
         *          
         * Read this link http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms173114.aspx it talks about functions and once you are done
         *
